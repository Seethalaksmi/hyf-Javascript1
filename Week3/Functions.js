function Sum(num1, num2, num3) { // Defining the function:
    return num1 + num2 + num3;

//2. Create a function named colorCar that receives a color, and prints out, 'a red car' for example.

function colorCar(color) {
    //console.log( 'a ' + color + ' car'); 
    return (console.log(`a ${color} car`));

//3. Create an object and a function that takes the object as a parameter and prints out all of its properties and values.

  }*/

//10. Use the list of vehicles to write an advertisement. So that it prints something like: "Amazing Joe's Garage, we service cars, motorbikes, caravans and bikes.". (Hint: use a for loop.)
let advertisement = ' ';

//12. Create an empty object.
let emptyObject = {};

//13. Create an object that contains the teachers that you have had so far for the different modules.

let teachers = { Teacher: ['christer', 'Garima', 'Gabe', 'Ivy', 'Max'] };

//14. Add a property to the object you just created that contains the languages that they have taught you.
teachers = { Teacher: ['christer', 'Garima', 'Gabe', 'Ivy', 'Max'], languages: ['Html', 'css', 'Javascript'] };

//15. Write some code to test two arrays for equality using == and ===. Test the following:

let x = [1, 2, 3];
let y = [1, 2, 3];
let z = y;
x == y ? console.log('x and y are equal') : console.log('x and y are not equal');
z == y ? console.log('z and y are equal') : console.log('z and y are not equal');
z == x ? console.log('z and x are equal') : console.log('z and x are not equal');
x === y ? console.log('x and y are strictly equal') : console.log('x and y are not strictly equal');
x === z ? console.log('x and z are strictly equal') : console.log('x and z are not strictly equal');
z === y ? console.log('z and y are strictly equal') : console.log('z and x are not strictly equal');

/*What do you think will happen with x == y, x === y and z == y and z == x? Prove it!
x == y --> x and y are not equal
x === y --> x and y are not strictly equal
z == y --> z and y are equal
z == x --> z and x are not equal*/

//16. Take a look at the following code:

let o1 = { foo: "bar1" };
let o2 = { foo: "bar" };
let o3 = o2;
/* Show that changing o2 changes o3 (or not) and changing o1 changes o3(or not).
Does the order that you assign (o3 = o2 or o2 = o3) matter?
Yes changing o2 changes o3. No changing 01 not changes 03.
yes o3=o2 returns o3 = obj o2; whereas o2=o3 returns error where o3 is undefined or  o2 is already declared*/

console.log(o3);

//17. What does the following code return? (And why?)

let bar = 42;
return (console.log(typeof typeof bar)); // here typeof typeof bar is string --> as typeof 42 is number but typeof number is string.
/*â€˜Coerce' means to try to change - so coercing var x = '6' to number means trying to change the type to number temporarily.*/
